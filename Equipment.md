The most important thing you need to consider when you want to start recording is a microphone. When you know what you want to record and how much you want to spend, it’s easier to choose equipment. 

Here is a list of things to think about when choosing a microphone: 

Sensitivity of the microphone

Connecting the microphone to a computer 

Podcast format 

Recording environment 

 

Types of microphones: 

Condenser vs Dynamic 

 

Condenser microphones tend to be more sensitive, which leads to more natural-sounding recordings. The downside is that they might record background noise, which is why it is important where you record. All this makes them more suitable for studio settings. 

Advantages: 

Performs better with high-frequency sounds.

Overall sound quality is better.

Disadvantages:

Very sensitive.

Requires external power source (in the case of traditional condenser microphones).

More suited for controlled environments, for example a studio.

 

Dynamic microphones are less sensitive and more durable, they also tend to be cheaper than their condenser counterparts. 

Advantages: 

Easy to use 

Durable

More forgiving

Affordable 

Versatile 

Disadvantages: 

Less sensitive 

Unsuitable for recording high-frequency sounds.

 

USB vs XLR

 

If you get a USB microphone, you don’t need any additional equipment, it’s a plug-and-play solution.

Advantages: 

Easy to use

Disadvantages: 

Limited USB cable length

 

If you choose an XLR microphone, you will have to spend money on additional equipment, such as a mixer or interface. That being said, it leaves you with a more professional setup that offers many possibilities; the interface or mixer acts as an external sound card. 

 

Advantages: 

Better sound quality

More recording flexibility

Disadvantages: 

Confusing for beginners

Usually more expensive
