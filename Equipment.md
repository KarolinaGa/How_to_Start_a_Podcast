# Equipment 
---

The most important thing you need to consider when you want to start recording is a microphone. When you know what you want to record and how much you want to spend, it’s easier to choose equipment. You need a microphone to ensure good quality audio and to sound professional. 

Here is a list of things to think about when choosing a microphone: 

- Sensitivity of the microphone

- Connecting the microphone to a computer

- Podcast format

- Recording environment

 
There are three main factors you need to look at: the type of the microphone, how it connects to a computer, and polar patterns. 



### Types of microphones: Condenser vs Dynamic.

They can come with either XLR or USB connections, but their characteristics remain the same.

Condenser microphones tend to be more sensitive, which leads to more natural-sounding recordings. The downside is that they might record background noise, which is why it is important where you record. All this makes them more suitable for studio settings. 

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|----------------|
| Performs better with high-frequency sounds| Very sensitive |
| Overall sound quality is better | Requires external power source (in the case of traditional condenser microphones)|
| | More suited for controlled environments, for example a studio |

 

Dynamic microphones are less sensitive and more durable, they also tend to be cheaper than their condenser counterparts. 

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|----------------|
| Easy to use | Less sensitive |
| Durable | Unsuitable for recording high-frequency sounds|
| More forgiving | |
| Affordable  | |
| Versatile  ||


 

### Connecting a microphone to a computer: USB vs XLR.

 

If you get a USB microphone, you don’t need any additional equipment, it’s a plug-and-play solution.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|----------------|
| Easy to use | Limited USB cable length |


 

If you choose an XLR microphone, you will have to spend money on additional equipment, such as a mixer or interface. That being said, it leaves you with a more professional setup that offers many possibilities; the interface or mixer acts as an external sound card. 

 

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|----------------|
|Better sound quality | Confusing for beginners|
|More recording flexibility | Usually more expensive|

**Examples**: 

- A condenser microphone with an XLR connection is often used in professional studio settings for high-fidelity recordings.

- A dynamic microphone with a USB connection might be used by podcasters who need a durable mic that connects directly to their computer.



 ### Polar Pattern 
  Also known as a pickup pattern, it describes the sensitivity of a microphone to sound coming from different directions.  It defines the microphone’s directional response, indicating which directions it picks up sound from and which directions it rejects. Different polar patterns, such as omnidirectional or cardioid, are suited for different recording situations.
