This guide was created to help record, edit, and publish a podcast. Starting a podcast may seem daunting, especially to those who are not tech-savvy, and the aim is to make the process as straightforward as possible. The guide focuses on using one of the most popular microphones, The Blue Yeti, and the free audio editing software Audacity.

A podcast is an audio program you can listen to at any time on any device that can be connected to the Internet. It is an amazing tool that can help you build a community, launch a business, or help people develop and learn new skills.

There are many podcast genres, such as:

- Comedy

- Educational

- Entertainment

- Personal Development

- Networking and community building

- Marketing and Branding

Once you choose the topic you want to talk about, it’s time to think about the audience and format. 

Here are some formats you can choose from:

- Solo: a single host delivers a monologue. Depending on the podcast it can be more scripted or casual. This format gives the host full control over the content.   

- Co-hosted/conversational: a co-hosted podcast is a format where two or more hosts talk about various topics, creating a dynamic and interactive listening experience. This format is characterized by the natural back-and-forth between the hosts, they often share their perspectives, insights, and anecdotes, making the content relatable and entertaining for the audience.https://open.spotify.com/show/4VxRubY9xlwcKYCHbBLY03 

- Interview: an interview podcast is a podcast format where the host(s) conduct conversations with guests, usually focusing on the guests' expertise, experiences, stories, or insights on a specific topic. 

- Roundtable:  a roundtable podcast is a format where a group of people come together to discuss a particular topic in an informal and conversational manner. Typically, these podcasts feature multiple hosts or guests who share their insights, opinions, and experiences on the subject at hand. The discussion is often spontaneous and dynamic, resembling a casual conversation rather than a formal interview or structured presentation. 

- Repurposed content: a repurposed content podcast is a type of podcast where existing content is adapted, reused, and presented in a new format or context. This content can come from various sources, such as articles, blog posts, videos, interviews.
