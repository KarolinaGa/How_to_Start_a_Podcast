**Directory** - a platform or service that lists and organizes podcasts, making them searchable and accessible to listeners. Podcast directories allow users to discover, subscribe to, and listen to podcasts. Some well-known podcast directories include Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, and Stitcher. These directories aggregate podcast RSS feeds, display episode information, and provide playback features to enhance the listener's experience.

**RSS feed** -  An RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feed in podcasting is an XML file that contains all the necessary information about a podcast, including its episodes, descriptions, and media files. This feed allows podcast directories and apps to automatically update and distribute new episodes to subscribers. By subscribing to the RSS feed, listeners receive new episodes directly in their podcast apps as soon as they are released.

**Polar Pattern** - also known as a pickup pattern, is the three-dimensional space around a microphone where it is most sensitive to sound. It defines the microphone’s directional response, indicating which directions it picks up sound from and which directions it rejects. Different polar patterns are suited for different recording situations.

**Pop filter** - also known as a pop shield or pop screen, is an accessory used in audio recording to reduce or eliminate the popping sounds caused by the fast-moving air when a person speaks or sings. These popping sounds, known as plosives, typically occur with certain consonants like "P," "B," "T," and "K." A pop filter helps to improve the overall sound quality by preventing these unwanted noises from being captured by the microphone.

**Reverberation** - also called reverb, is the persistence of sound in a particular space after the original sound is produced. It occurs when sound waves reflect off surfaces such as walls, ceilings, and floors, and then bounce back to the listener’s ears. This creates a series of echoes that blend together, giving the impression of a continuous sound. Reverb is a crucial element in audio production, music, and sound design as it adds depth and a sense of space to the audio.
